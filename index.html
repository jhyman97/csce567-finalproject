                <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>It is no secret that electric vehicles (EVs) have been more and more prominent throughout the world 
                since recent years. Not even 4 or 5 years ago, it would be a fairly rare occurrence to encounter one 
                while driving, but that has now changed with the increasing popularity of EVs. This can be attributed 
                to a number of different things, such as the impressive software capabilities they offer, being the 
                arguably cleaner energy version of their gas alternatives, as well as the much cheaper cost it takes to 
                charge an EV compared to filling up a car with gasoline. They will most likely not surpass the amount 
                of gas-powered cars out on the roads in the near future, however it is hard not to take notice to how 
                much they have sprawled in popularity within such a short frame of time.</p>
            <p>
                Though, their popularity comes at the cost of controversy--they have become topics of heated debate with things such as the argument 
                of whether or not EVs really are more environmentally friendly over gasoline powered vehicles, as well 
                as some having concerns over how expensive the average EV currently goes for. Despite this, the ever-increasing popularity of EVs present a different side of the story, perhaps implying that these concerns 
                are not as important or as outspoken as presented in the media.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of the following visualizations is to graphically demonstrate the rapid growth of EVs around the world and compare this to 
                their environmental impact, namely their electricity demand and oil displacement. It is projected that total EV sales by 2035 are to increase by 536%, however their
                electricty demand and oil displacement are also to increase by 1443% and 1114% respectively.
            </p>

            <h2>Total EV Sales</h2>
            <p>
                Total EV sales detail the total amount of electric vehicles sold since 2010. 
                EVs accounted for about 18% of all cars sold within 2023, which is a 14% increase from 2022. However, these sales are significantly concentrated in a few 
                geographical areas, where just under 60% of new EV registrations were made in China, just under 25% in Europe, and 10% in the United States, which make up nearly 
                95% of all global electric car sales. If these trends continue, then by the end of 2024, electric car sales could account for more than one in five cars sold worldwide.

            <h2>Electricity Demand of EVs</h2>
            <p>
                Electricity demand of EVs graph the total amount of electricity taken by EVs in GWh (Gigawatt hours, 1 GWh = 1,000,000 kWh = 1,000,000,000 Wh). 
                Of course, with the globally increasing amount of EVs being produced, this would translate to a higher electricity demand. Globally, in 2023, EVs consumed 
                around 120 TWh (Terawatt hours, 1 TWh = 1000 GWh), which is the same as Norway's total electricty demand in the same year. EVs accounted for around 0.5% of 
                the world's total electricity consumption in 2023, and around 1% in China and Europe. China is the largest consumer of electricity for EVs, accounting for about 45% 
                for electricity demand, however their share is projected to fall down to less than 30% by 2035 due to a strong EV growth in both Europe and the United States.

            <h2>Oil Displacement</h2>
            <p>
                Oil displacement graphs the decrease in gas and diesel consumption (in millions of barrels per day), resulting from the increased use of EVs. Globally, by 2030, 
                6 million barrels per day of oil are to be displaced by EVs, and will soon be projected to displace twice that amount by 2035. This is largely attributed to electric 
                LDVs (light duty vehicles), trucks, buses and 2/3Ws (two and three wheeled vehicles). Electric 2/3Ws are still fairly new but rising in popularity alongside regular EVs, 
                and can displace other modes of travel such as walking or cycling rather than fossil-powered transport, so while EVs are a key part of transport decarbonization, they are 
                far from being the only ones. By 2030, China, Europe and the US are projected to surpass 1 million barrels per day each, and at least 2 million barrels per day each by 2035.
